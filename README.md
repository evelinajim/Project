Analyzing datasets with R Studio.

In this program, I am reading in a large dataset where then we are creating a visualization bargraph. A user may select a name from a 
dropdown list that connects to a server with the data stored in Javascript (this tactic prevents the page from having rundown issues).
Once a user selects a name, the graph will be updated for that specific name.

A user may also select a time on the timeline. If they select a year, the second text will have an updated list of 6 names 
that are most popular during that time.
